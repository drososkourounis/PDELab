\section*{Solution of Poisson's equation}
We seek the discrete solution of the vector Poisson's equation
\begin{align*}
-&\nabla^2 \u(x, y, z) = \f(x,y, z), \quad \in \Omega \\
&\n \cdot \nabla \u   = 0, \quad y=1, z=1,\\
&\u(x, y, z) = \u_0(x, y, z), \text{otherwise},
\end{align*}
where $\Omega = [0,1]^3$. We discretize the domain $\Omega$ using a quadrilateral $N_x \times N_y \times N_z$ grid of trilinear elements. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the analytical expression of $\f(x,y)$ so that the exact 
solution of the PDE is \[u_{0,x} = u_{0,y} = u_{0,z} =x\, e^{-(y-1)^2 (z-1)^2}.\] 
\item Solve the problem by assuming an ordering of the variables per vector component,
more precisely assume that the solution vector is 
\begin{align}
\left (
\begin{array}{ccc}
U_x^T & U_y^T & U_z^T
\end{array}
\right )^T
\end{align}
where $U_x$ contains all the unknowns corresponding to the $x$ component, etc.
\item Next reorder the variables so that each node contains all the components. 
Your solution vector obtains the form:
\begin{align}
\left (
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
u_{1_x} & u_{1_y} & u_{1_z} & \cdots & u_{n_x} & u_{n_y} & u_{n_z}
\end{array}
\right )^T
\end{align}
For the permutation (reordering) of the original matrix and vector familiarize your self
with the MATLAB function \lstinline+repmat+\footnote{Experiment with a 6 x 6 matrix to understand permuting a matrix and permuting it back. If the permutation routine works correctly then permuting the matrix back using the inverse permutation should result to the original matrix before the permutation was applied. Suppose $p$ is the permutation vector. Then the inverse permutation $pinv$ satisfies $p(pinv(i)) = pinv(p(i)) = i$}. Compute the permutation array
and then write a function that accepts the matrix to be permuted \lstinline+A+,
the vector (rhs) to be permuted and the permutation array \lstinline+p+,
and returns the permuted matrix and vector. Use \lstinline+spy()+ to see the result
of the permutation. And provide in your report pictures of both the original matrix
and the permuted one. Solve the permuted system measuring the times for the backslash
and CG with ichol preconditioning. Note that for using ichol, you should apply the 
boundary conditions keeping the symmetry of the matrix. Permute back the solution
to the original ordering and compare to the solution you obtained at the previous 
step. Are they the same?

\item Finally assemble the matrix from the very beginning so that its ordering
is identical to that of the previous step, meaning that you need to assemble
vector mass and stiffness element matrices. 
Provide the spy plot of the matrix. Compare the solution with the solution of 
the previous step. Think how the code should be structured. Attach the code 
for the vector assembly, the code for the permutation of the matrix and the vector
in your assignment. 
\end{enumerate}
